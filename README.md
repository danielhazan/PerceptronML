# PerceptronML

this project was the 2nd project in machine learning course (2nd year huji).
contains implementations for the Perceptron classifier algorithm, K nearest neighbors (knn) algorithm, 
and building the ROC curves for computing error rates (positive &amp; negative) of the models. 
the project uses numpy library.
